The enemy
Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one and the same
You take all of the pain away
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh, you take all of the pain away, away, away (away, away, away)
Save me if I become my demons
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything (my demons) okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay, my demons)
We are one and the same
Oh, you take all of the pain (my demons) away, away, away (away, away, away, my demons)
Save me if I become my demons
